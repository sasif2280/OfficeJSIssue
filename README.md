This is the Simle Word addin which will replicate the issue which is:-

while configuring the store in this example we are able to grab the document URL in case of Desktop but in case of Browser we cannot.

once created the same addin first enter command 
npm run build

then in browser upload the manifest file and open the console windown of taskpane you will see logs.

please go source add breakpoints in store.js file to see the code flow. and observe the behaviour for desktop addin and browser addin.

Thank you.
